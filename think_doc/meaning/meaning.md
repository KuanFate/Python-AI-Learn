When I practice in the game, I want to know how I can be stronger.
I can choose the hero that I have practiced many times.

I may learn much knowledge, but I don't use this knowledge.
How can I use this knowledge?
I just learn this knowledge for finding a job.
I just want to make money.
So when I learn AI knowledge, I felt it's very long travel.
I want to skip some contents, how can I skip knowledge?

I played game, I spent much time in practice because I want to win many times.
But the result is that I lost many times.
So if I don't play game, I always think about it, but when I play games, I find it's
difficult to win.
When I lost the game, I felt angry and upset.
When I saw the video, I knot that I just for myself become stronger.
The game or the women are just the tool for me to become stronger.

I like the video, I just need to become stronger and spend money for becoming
stronger.
So since women is the tool for me to become stronger, I don't need to spend
much time on them because I can use time to earn more money.
Spending more time on myself, learning more knowledge.

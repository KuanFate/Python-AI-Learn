When I practice in the game, I want to know how I can be stronger.
I can choose the hero that I have practiced many times.

I may learn much knowledge, but I don't use this knowledge.
How can I use this knowledge?
I just learn this knowledge for finding a job.
I just want to make money.
So when I learn AI knowledge, I felt it's very long travel.
I want to skip some contents, how can I skip knowledge?

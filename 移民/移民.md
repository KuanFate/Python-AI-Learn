**黑在美国**
尊严法案 Dignity Act 通过，或许黑在美国也行。。。

正常去美国，签证排期难，算了，花费大，好好在中国也挺好。
长期考虑，美国比中国更有潜力。
短期考虑，房贷，李永欢的教育花费，澳洲或许还行。
先去上海。

Why is it very hard to learn English?
Because I always use chinese in my life.
Comparing to programming, it likes that I always use
golang to finish my work. I only use python when I am studying.
So I am lack of practice of python. You know, practice makes perfect.
So if I only use English when I study English, I probably can't study 
English very well.
Because English is a language, I need to use it.
When I study program, I don't just learn it, I usually
write code. Of course, I will make many mistakes.
But it doesn't matter, because I know the most important thing is that
I use the language. Grammar mistakes may be important in exam.
But if you want to live abroad, you just need to use more english in your life.

I think that there are many levels of learning English.
Level 1, you just learn the grammar and some words.
Level 2, you need to use english in your life and can express your meaning.
Level 3, you are familiar with English and make less mistakes.

So I am in level 2, I don't need to care much about English grammar mistakes.
The most important thing is practicing and trying to avoid using software to translate
what you want to say.
You only need it to translate some words or phrase.
You need to learn how to organize what you want to say.
